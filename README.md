# SplitVideoAtHardCuts
A dirty script written in typescript that will use ffmpeg in order to split a video file into multiple scenes based off of the analysis and detection of a visual scene change. This is very useful for old home video footage that has no scene detection metadata on it. If you are interested in using it, contact me and I'll clean it up and provide a readme. Otherwise, feel free to do whatever.
